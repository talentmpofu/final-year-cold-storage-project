## Project Overview

This is a new project workspace. Update this section with:

- Primary purpose and goals of the project
- Target users or use cases
- Key technologies and frameworks used

## Architecture

Document the high-level architecture once established:

- Major components and their responsibilities
- Data flow between components
- External service integrations
- Database schema or data models (if applicable)

## Development Workflow

Update with project-specific commands:

```bash
# Build: [Add build command]
# Test: [Add test command]
# Run: [Add run command]
# Deploy: [Add deployment steps]
```

## Code Conventions

Document conventions as they emerge:

- Naming patterns for files, classes, functions
- Directory structure and organization
- Error handling approaches
- Logging/debugging practices

## Key Files & Directories

List important files once created:

- Configuration files and their purposes
- Entry points for different components
- Test file locations
- Documentation locations

## Dependencies & Integration Points

Document external dependencies:

- Third-party libraries and why they're used
- API integrations and authentication methods
- Environment variables and configuration

## Notes for AI Agents

Add project-specific guidance:

- Common tasks and how to accomplish them
- Gotchas or non-obvious behaviors
- Performance considerations
- Security requirements

## Images & Media

- Storage: Keep assets under `docs/assets/` (create if missing). Use web-friendly names like `cold-unit-diagram.png`.
- Referencing in Markdown (from this file): `![Cold storage architecture](../docs/assets/cold-unit-diagram.svg)`.
- Screenshots: Prefer PNG for UI, JPEG for photos, SVG for diagrams when available.
- Size: Optimize images to < 1MB when possible to keep the repo lean.
- Diagrams: If editable, store source (e.g., `.drawio`, `.pptx`) in `docs/diagrams/` and export PNG/SVG to `docs/assets/`.
- Privacy: Do not include secrets or identifiable data in screenshots.
